Implement ruby-debug-ide19 client for Vim

tested with ruby-1.9.2 (1.9.3 causes errors with ruby-debug19)

STATUS: This is working:
- stepping
- breakpoints
- var view and more stuff coming soon (help welcome)

USAGE:
  ! Requires client-server, thus X or patched Vim (eg nox patch, see vim-addon-async)

  1)
  # this installs ruby-debug19 and linecache19 as well:
  gem install ruby-debug-ide19

  # get my patched version of ruby-debug-ide19
  # I'm trying to feed these changes upstream
  # thus the next two commands will not be needed in the future.

  git clone -b json https://github.com/MarcWeber/ruby-debug-ide.git

  # make sure the files of my version are found first:
  RUBYLIB=`pwd`/lib:$RUBYLIB

  # start the debugger server, if my changes are accepted this will just be
  # rdebug-ide -J ..
  ruby bin/rdebug-ide -- -J /tmp/test.rb

  2) make vim connect to the debug server:
  :RDStart

  set breakpoint using F9

  4) start execution by
  :RDCommand start
  
  6) step by F6 etc

INSTALLATION:

dependencies:
  - see addon-info.json
  - socat executable (probably nc/netcat works as well)

Using VAM:
  add the name "vim-addon-ruby-debug-ide" to the list of plugins to be
  installed.

=============
github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-rdebug
An implementation which works with require 'debug' only.

https://github.com/astashov/vim-ruby-debugger
So why did it start this project? I want maintainable minimal and reusable code.
That's why this implementation is based on vim-addons-signs and vim-addon-async.
The code in this repo is about 500 LOC currently, not 2000.

It works nice and fast (but may crash vim sometimes), vim-ruby-debugger fails
pointing to the current breakpoint when using this mapping and hitting hit a
couple of times fast.
  noremap <F6>  :call ruby_debugger#load_debugger() <bar> call g:RubyDebugger.step()<CR>
The author told me it may happen occasionally - but did not for him. Well - I
want to work fast.

TODO / BUGS
  - upload json protocol implementation for ruby-debug-ide19 to my github page (done)
    and submit merge request when done (requested)
  - check which features of implementation are missing
  - test
  - implemennt support for enabling / disabling breakpoints ?
    (because lines in the breakpoint view can be commented this is not urgent)


TROUBLE SHOOTING:

invalid option: -J, you have the wrong ruby-debug-ide19 version which does not
have my json protocl patch. See INSTALLATION.
